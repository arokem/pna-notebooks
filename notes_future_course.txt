- background in python - which level ? 

- one dataset through the whole class
- using existing tools like nipype -  scripts or  teach the methods ? 
- takes years to learn imaging in depth - 

- some of methods aspects are standard:
    * realignment
    * slice timing
    * smoothing
    
    These could be less in depth - use standard black box after understanding principle - conceptionial knowledge but not necessarily how to manually code this

- some aspects are more crucial and more variable to analysis : 
    * stat analysis 
    * aspect of processing where there's no standard / 

- Planning aspect : know exactly what's going to be taught and keep to the planning

- notebooks in class : figuring both how the code works AND the brain imaging concepts - 
eg : if I know already the concept of slice timing - I can know see how it is implemented 

- background reading : cbu web pages - Jeanette Mumford centering regressor- fmri handbook - GLM paper 

- student background : linear algebra - matrices - some programing (python) - t-F tests -
